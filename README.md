# Terribly Hacked FTP

![built with Vue.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/built_with_Vue.js-4FC08D.svg?logo=vue.js&logoColor=fff)

~~This will maybe work.~~ We did it!

## Requirements

- Node 10+
- yarn 13
- ~~JDK (After the server is configured)~~ Only works with root directory opened inside IDEA IntelliJ

## Usage

```bash

#Copy and edit config
$ cp sample.config.js config.js && $EDITOR config.js
# Install dependencies
$ yarn
# Build and run
$ yarn start

```

Start Java Server to expose FTP to other clients. Start Java Client to interact with other FTPs.

Avoid working directly on the master branch. Use forks or branches as illustrated [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Go wild in your branches and do whatever tbh.
